## Problem statement:
In a company, 4000 employees, and every year 15% of employees are leaving the company.we have to analyse the reason as well we will predict based on the features if the employees leave the company or not.


Notes after EDA and building the model:
<br/>
1.The performance of developed model is excellent and it can be deployed to predict future employee attrition.
2.We found a lot of insights about employee attrition during EDA.
3. Few major caused of employee attrition includes human resource work, bad work life balance, frequent travels, and unmarried employees.so, in order to reduce attrition company should focus on these reasons.
